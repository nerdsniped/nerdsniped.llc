Hi! I'm Samuel Giddins (aka `@segiddins`), and I'm the principal of Nerdsniped LLC.

I started Nerdsniped in January of 2023, after quitting a highly unsatisfactory job.
Realizing that I needed some time to recover, I decided to spend some time contracting.
Over the past 5 months, I've been working full-time as a contractor, and doing so via Nerdsniped (aka this very LLC).

Why Nerdsniped?
Well, there's an <Link href="https://xkcd.com" className="font-mono">xkcd</Link> for that:

As an engineer, I get nerdsniped a lot.
Once presented with an interesting problem... well, it's hard for me to put it down until I've solved it.

Many of the projects listed on this site are the result of me being nerdsniped.

As the principal of Nerdsniped LLC, I'm available to be nerdsniped by you, in exchange for money. <Link href="mailto:segiddins@nerdsniped.llc">Get in touch</Link>.
